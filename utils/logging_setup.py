"""
Configures Python's standard logging for the whole application.
 
Output goes to two places simultaneously:
  - stdout (console), so you can watch it live or pipe it to journald on the VPS
  - a rotating log file, so you keep history without the file growing forever
 
The rotating file caps at 5 MB and keeps the last 3 files.
That's enough to diagnose issues that surfaced hours ago without eating disk space.
 
Log level is read from config so you can switch to DEBUG in .env when needed without touching this file.
