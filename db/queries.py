"""
All database read and write operations for the app.
 
Design rules followed here:
  - Every function takes a connection as its first argument.
    No global state - callers control which connection is used.
  - All writes use an explicit try/commit/except rollback pattern instead of 'with conn:'. Python 3.12 changed the behaviour of the connection context manager (it now starts an explicit transaction), which can cause FK checks to fail when a prior 'with conn:' block committed a parent row that the next block's transaction can't yet see. Explicit commits are unambiguous on every Python version.
  - Timestamps are stored in the local system timezone, not UTC.
    _now() returns local time; _localise() converts incoming UTC datetimes (e.g. message.date from Telethon) to local time before storage.
    Exception: chats.first_seen and senders.first_seen use SQLite's DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (UTC) - they're metadata, not message times.
  - archived_at in insert_message is passed explicitly so it uses local time rather than falling back to SQLite's UTC DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
  - INSERT OR IGNORE is used where duplicate arrivals are possible (e.g. Telegram sometimes re-delivers events on reconnect).
  - Functions return meaningful values (row ID, bool, fetched row) so callers can log or react without querying again.
  - Boolean flags in the schema are INTEGER (0/1). Comparisons use 1/0 rather than TRUE/FALSE to stay consistent with the DDL and avoid any SQLite version dependency.

    Actor inference (deleted_by_inference):
    computed for two cases where it's a structural fact rather than a guess, everything else stays 'unknown' (the column's own DEFAULT):

      - Broadcast channels: only admins can delete channel posts, so any deletion there is 'channel_admin'.
      - Saved Messages (chat_id == self_id, the archiving account's own Telegram user ID):
        only the account owner has access to their own Saved Messages — no one else can even see it, let alone delete from it — so any deletion there is 'self'.

    Deliberately NOT attempted for ordinary private chats, groups, or supergroups:
    Telegram allows any party to delete a message for everyone with no time limit and no record of who did it,
    so a sender_id-based guess there would be closer to a coin flip than a signal.
    See api/schemas/message.py's DeletionOut docstring for the full reasoning.

    self_id is optional (defaults to None) so existing callers/tests that don't have it handy still work — Saved Messages just won't be detected without it,
    falling back to 'unknown' same as any other private chat.

    Note the distinction from "did this deletion event carry a chat_id" — Telegram's updateDeleteChannelMessages fires for supergroups too,
    not just channels (see handlers/on_delete.py's docstring), and supergroups behave like ordinary groups for deletion permissions.
