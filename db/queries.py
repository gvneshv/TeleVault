"""
All database read and write operations for the app.
 
Design rules followed here:
  - Every function takes a connection as its first argument.
    No global state - callers control which connection is used.
  - All writes use an explicit try/commit/except rollback pattern instead of 'with conn:'. Python 3.12 changed the behaviour of the connection context manager (it now starts an explicit transaction), which can cause FK checks to fail when a prior 'with conn:' block committed a parent row that the next block's transaction can't yet see. Explicit commits are unambiguous on every Python version.
  - Timestamps are stored in the local system timezone, not UTC.
    _now() returns local time; _localise() converts incoming UTC datetimes (e.g. message.date from Telethon) to local time before storage.
    Exception: chats.first_seen and senders.first_seen use SQLite's DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (UTC) - they're metadata, not message times.
  - archived_at in insert_message is passed explicitly so it uses local time rather than falling back to SQLite's UTC DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
  - INSERT OR IGNORE is used where duplicate arrivals are possible (e.g. Telegram sometimes re-delivers events on reconnect).
  - Functions return meaningful values (row ID, bool, fetched row) so callers can log or react without querying again.
  - Boolean flags in the schema are INTEGER (0/1). Comparisons use 1/0 rather than TRUE/FALSE to stay consistent with the DDL and avoid any SQLite version dependency.
