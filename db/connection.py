"""
Manages the SQLite connection for the entire application.
 
It uses a single shared connection rather than opening/closing one per query.
SQLite handles this fine for a single-process app like TeleVault, and it avoids the overhead of reconnecting on every write event.
 
WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode is enabled because it allows reads and writes to happen concurrently without blocking each other - important when Telethon's event loop is constantly firing while you might also be querying the DB manually.

Datetime handling
-----------------
Python 3.12 deprecated the built-in sqlite3 datetime adapters/converters and they are removed in later versions. Rather than rely on them, this module registers explicit ones that work on every Python version:
 
  - Adapter  (Python -> SQLite): datetime -> ISO 8601 TEXT string
  - Converter (SQLite -> Python): TEXT column declared DATETIME -> datetime
