"""
Handles Telethon's NewMessage event — fired for every message that arriveson the account, both incoming and outgoing (including Saved Messages).

Flow per event:
  1. Resolve the text to store — either the message body or a synthesized call label for MessageActionPhoneCall service messages.
  2. Skip if there is nothing worth archiving (media-only, stickers, etc.).
  3. Extract the chat entity and upsert it into `chats`.
  4. Extract the sender entity (if any) and upsert it into `senders`.
  5. Insert the message into `messages`.

We call `await event.get_chat()` and `await event.get_sender()` rather than reading `event.chat` / `event.sender` directly.
The direct attributes are only populated when Telegram includes the full entity in the update packet, which isn't guaranteed — the async getters always fetch from cache or the server.

        Call service messages (MessageActionPhoneCall) are stored with a synthesized label such as "[Missed call]" or "[Voice call · 2 min 17 sec]" so they appear meaningfully in the archive and can be flagged as deleted like any other row.
