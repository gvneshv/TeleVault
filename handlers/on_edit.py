"""
Handles Telethon's MessageEdited event - fired when a message's text is changed by its sender.
 
Why we bother archiving edits:
  A common pattern is editing -> deleting. Someone writes something, edits it
  (maybe to soften it), then deletes it. Without the edit history, the archive
  shows only the final text before deletion. With it, you get the full picture.
 
Flow per event:
  1. Confirm the edited message has text (skip media caption changes for now).
  2. Call queries.record_edit, which:
       a. Fetches the current text from the DB (becomes old_text).
       b. Writes a row to message_edits with old -> new.
       c. Updates messages with the new text and sets is_edited = TRUE.
  3. Ensure the chat and sender are in the DB first, same as on_message.
     (Edge case: a message could be edited in a chat we somehow missed
     archiving - the FK would fail without the upsert guard.)
