def format_call_text(action: MessageActionPhoneCall) -> str:

    Produce a human-readable archive label for a phone/video call service message, used as the stored `text` value in the messages table.

    Telegram does not deliver calls as regular messages — they arrive as MessageService events whose `action` field is MessageActionPhoneCall.
    TeleVault stores them as ordinary message rows with a synthetic text label so they appear naturally in the archive and can be flagged as deleted like any other message.

    Label format examples:
        [Video call · 4 min 32 sec]
        [Voice call · 1 min 08 sec]
        [Missed call]
        [Declined call]
