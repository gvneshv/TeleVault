"""
Handles Telethon's MessageDeleted event - fired when one or more messages are removed from a chat.
 
The important protocol limitation documented here:
 
    Telegram's server sends two different update types for deletions:
      - updateDeleteMessages        (private chats, legacy groups)
      - updateDeleteChannelMessages (channels, supergroups)
 
    Only the channel variant includes the chat ID. For private chats and
    groups, Telegram tells us WHICH messages were deleted but not WHERE.
    This is not a Telethon bug - it's the raw MTProto protocol.
 
Consequences and how we handle them:
  - event.chat_id is set   -> standard flag_deleted(chat_id, msg_id)
  - event.chat_id is None  -> fall back to flagging by message ID only,
    which may match the same tg_message_id in multiple chats (rare but possible). Logged.

    Flag a message as deleted when the chat ID is unknown.
 
    Searches by tg_message_id alone and flags all matching rows. In practice
    the same numeric message ID rarely exists in multiple chats simultaneously,
    but it's theoretically possible since Telegram scopes IDs per chat.

    When multiple matches are found, we cross-reference the chats table for
    the stored name and @username. This doesn't resolve the ambiguity
    automatically (the protocol gives us nothing to go on), but it makes the
    log entry human-readable so you can tell at a glance which chats were
    affected rather than staring at a list of raw IDs.
