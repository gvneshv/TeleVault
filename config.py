"""
Loads all runtime configuration from environment variables (via a .env file).
 
The settings are exposed as a single frozen dataclass instance — `settings` — imported directly wherever needed:
 
    from config import settings
    print(settings.db_path)
 
Why a dataclass rather than reading os.environ inline?
  - One import gives you everything; no hunting for os.getenv() calls scattered around the codebase.
  - The frozen=True flag prevents accidental mutation after startup.
  - Type annotations document what each setting is supposed to be.
  - Missing required values fail loudly at startup, not halfway through a run.
 
Required .env keys:       TG_API_ID, TG_API_HASH, TG_PHONE
Optional (have defaults): DB_PATH, SESSION_NAME, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FILE
