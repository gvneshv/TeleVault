"""
One-off / on-demand script to archive historical messages - the ones sent before TeleVault was running, or before a chat was ever seen by it.

Run with:
    python backfill.py                      # every chat you're in
    python backfill.py --chat @someusername  # one chat only
    python backfill.py --chat -1001234567890 # one chat by numeric ID
    python backfill.py --chat @someusername --limit 500  # cap per chat, useful for testing

Important limitations - Telegram's API, not something TeleVault can work around:
  - Deleted messages cannot be backfilled.
    Telegram's history API only returns messages that currently exist in a chat.
    If a message was deleted before TeleVault started archiving that chat, that history is gone - there is no way to recover it.
  - Edit history cannot be backfilled either.
    Only the CURRENT (latest) text of each historical message is available,
    so backfilled messages are stored as not-yet-edited (is_edited=0) even if they actually were edited before backfill ran.
    There's no way to see prior versions of a message you didn't already have archived.

Do not run this at the same time as main.py (the live userbot) against the same .session file - Telethon sessions support one active connection at a time.
Stop main.py first, run this, then start main.py again.

Idempotent: insert_message() uses INSERT OR IGNORE (see db/queries.py), so running this more than once,
or interrupting it partway through and re-running later, is always safe - already-archived messages are silently skipped, never duplicated.
