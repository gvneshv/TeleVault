/**
 * Health view.
 *
 * Fetches GET /api/health and shows the API's own liveness report:
 * whether the SQLite file is readable, whether a Telethon session exists, and the current archived message count.
 * See api/routes/health.py for exactly what each check does and doesn't cover
 * (notably: it does NOT confirm the userbot is currently connected to Telegram — that needs IPC, a Phase 3 addition per that file's own docstring).
 *
 * No polling — this is a manually-refreshed diagnostic view, not a live dashboard.
 * Deliberately simple: one fetch, one refresh button.
 * Adding auto-refresh is a small change later if it turns out to be wanted, not something to build speculatively now.
 *
 * Lazy-initialized by app.js on first tab open, same pattern as the other non-landing views.
