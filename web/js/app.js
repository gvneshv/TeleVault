/**
 * App shell controller.
 *
 * Scope of this file, deliberately:
 * switching the visible section when a nav link is clicked, and delegating each view's lazy initialization — nothing else.
 * Views themselves own their fetching/rendering logic.
 *
 * This is the single ES module entry point for the app (see index.html's one <script type="module" src="/js/app.js">).
 * It imports every view module, which is what actually causes their code to run at all — an unimported ES module's top-level code
 * (e.g. chats.js's own DOMContentLoaded listener) never executes, unlike a classic <script> tag which always runs once loaded.
 * chats.js is imported for that side effect only (it self-initializes as the landing view);
 * the other four export an init() called lazily below, the first time their tab is opened.
 *
 * No client-side router or URL hash handling yet.
 * Adding one is a reasonable future step once there are per-item views (e.g. a single chat or message) that benefit from being linkable/bookmarkable
 * — not needed for the nav-only shell.
