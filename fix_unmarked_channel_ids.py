One-off script: find chats/supergroups/channels stored under their raw (unmarked) chat_id - the backfill.py bug, fixed in this same batch - and merge them into their
correctly marked counterpart via the existing chat_migrations + merge_migrated_chats machinery.

Safe to run repeatedly: chats with no raw-ID duplicate are left untouched.
