"""
FastAPI dependencies shared across route modules.

Currently provides a single dependency: get_db(), which yields a read-only SQLite connection for the duration of one request and closes it in the finally block — whether the request succeeds or raises an exception.

Why read-only URI mode?
    Opening the SQLite file with "file:path?mode=ro" means SQLite will hard-error if any code accidentally attempts a write.
    This is the right safeguard given that the userbot and API share the same file: writes from both sides simultaneously, even if rare, can corrupt WAL state.

Why a new connection per request rather than a pool?
    SQLite connections are cheap.
    A connection pool adds complexity without benefit at this scale (single user, personal tool).
    If this changes when migrating to PostgreSQL in Phase 4, this is the only file that needs updating — all route code uses the `db: Connection` parameter unchanged.
