"""
GET /api/health — liveness check for the API server and its dependencies.

Used by:
    - The web UI to show a status indicator
    - Systemd / monitoring to confirm the process is alive
    - Future: heartbeat from the userbot process (Phase 3)

What this checks vs. what it doesn't:
    ✓ Database file is readable and returns rows
    ✓ Telethon .session file exists on disk
    ✗ Whether the userbot is currently connected to Telegram (that requires IPC — a Phase 3 addition, see CHANGELOG)
