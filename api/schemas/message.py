    `resolved_name` is a computed field (see @computed_field below) — it IS included in the serialized JSON response, unlike a plain @property,
    which Pydantic never serializes.
    Previously this logic only existed as a Python-side convenience with no API presence,
    so consumers (the web UI's messages.js and deleted.js) each duplicated the same priority chain in JavaScript.

    the frontend just reads sender.resolved_name.
