# TeleVault

A personal Telegram userbot that archives all your messages in real time and
preserves deleted ones so you can retrieve them later — with a web UI to
browse, search, and review what's been archived.

**Phase 1 (userbot):** text messages only, all chat types, local SQLite storage.
**Phase 2 (web UI):** read-only REST API + installable PWA — Chats, Messages,
Deleted, Stats, and Health views, with EN/UK language support and light/dark themes.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- A Telegram account
- Telegram API credentials (free - takes two minutes to get)

---

## 1. Get your Telegram API credentials

1. Go to **https://my.telegram.org** and log in with your phone number.
2. Click **"API development tools"**.
3. Fill in any app name and short name (e.g. `televault` / `tvault`) - these
   are just labels, they don't affect anything.
4. Copy your **App api_id** (a number) and **App api_hash** (a hex string).

> Keep these secret. Anyone with your api_id + api_hash can impersonate your
> app (though not your account without the login code).

---

## 2. Set up the project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Gvneshv/TeleVault.git
cd TeleVault

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```
TG_API_ID=12345678
TG_API_HASH=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
TG_PHONE=+1234567890          # your number in international format
```

The other settings have sensible defaults - you can leave them as-is for now.

---

## 4. First run

```bash
python main.py
```

**First-time only:** Telethon will prompt you for the verification code that
Telegram sends to your account (just like logging into a new device). Enter
it and press Enter. A `televault.session` file is created - this stores your
login so you won't be asked again.

You should see output like:

```
2026-05-12 18:00:00  INFO      utils.logging_setup    Logging initialised - level=INFO
2026-05-12 18:00:01  INFO      __main__               Starting TeleVault.
2026-05-12 18:00:02  INFO      __main__               Authenticated as: Alice (id=123456789)
2026-05-12 18:00:02  INFO      __main__               Event handlers registered.
2026-05-12 18:00:02  INFO      __main__               TeleVault is running. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
```

From this point, TeleVault is archiving every text message in real time.

---

## 5. Smoke test

With TeleVault running, open Telegram on your phone or desktop and:

1. **Send yourself a message** (open Saved Messages and type anything).
   You should see a log line:
   ```
   INFO  db.queries  Inserted message 1 from chat 123456789 -> internal id 1
   ```

2. **Delete that message.**
   You should see:
   ```
   INFO  db.queries  Flagged message 1 in chat 123456789 as deleted at ...
   ```

3. **Query the database directly** to confirm:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 data/televault.db "
     SELECT text, is_deleted, deleted_at
     FROM messages
     ORDER BY archived_at DESC
     LIMIT 5;
   "
   ```

---

## 6. Stopping TeleVault

Press **Ctrl-C**. The shutdown is graceful - the database connection is
flushed and closed cleanly before the process exits.

---

## 7. Launch the web UI

The web UI is a separate process from the userbot — both can run at the same
time, reading/writing the same SQLite file (the API only ever reads).

```bash
uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in a browser. You should see the Chats
view load first, with Messages, Deleted, Stats, and Health in the nav rail.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Installable as an app:** most browsers will offer to install it (via the
  address bar or browser menu) since it ships a PWA manifest and service
  worker. Installed or not, it works the same.
- **Offline behaviour:** the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS) is cached for offline
  loading, but data always requires a live connection — `/api/*` is
  deliberately excluded from the cache, since this is private data and a
  stale cached result would be misleading, not just old.
- **Theme and language:** toggle in the top-right of the nav rail (☀/☾ for
  theme, EN/UK for language). Both persist across visits via `localStorage`.
- **Interactive API docs:** available at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`
  (Swagger UI) if you want to explore the endpoints directly.
- **Deployment note:** for always-on use, run this the same way as the
  userbot (systemd, etc.), with Nginx proxying `/api/*` to this process and
  serving `/` — see `api/server.py`'s docstring for the exact setup.

## Notes

- **`.session` file:** treat it like a password. It lets anyone run requests
  as your Telegram account. It's excluded from git via `.gitignore`.
- **Telegram ToS:** TeleVault archives only messages from chats you're already
  part of, for personal use. It doesn't automate sending, scrape public
  content, or interact with other accounts - it stays well within the
  acceptable personal-use boundary.
- **Media messages** (photos, stickers, voice notes) are silently skipped in
  Phase 1. The log will show a `DEBUG` line for each skipped message if you
  set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `.env`.
- **The web UI has no authentication.** `api/server.py` doesn't check any
  credentials — anyone who can reach the port can read your entire archive,
  including deleted messages. Fine for `127.0.0.1`-only local use; if you
  deploy this on a VPS reachable from the internet, put it behind something
  that authenticates first (e.g. Nginx with basic auth, a VPN, or an
  SSH tunnel) rather than exposing the port directly. Login/auth for the web
  UI itself isn't planned yet=.
